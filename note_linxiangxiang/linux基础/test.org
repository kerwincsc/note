       **** Lord of the Rings
          My favorite scenes are (in this order)
          1. The attack of the Rohirrim
          2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
             + this was already my favorite scene in the book
             + I really like Miranda Otto.
          3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
             - on DVD only

          But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
          Important actors in this film are:
          - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
          - Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
            him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.
